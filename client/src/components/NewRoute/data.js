Some minor shortcomings: Charger may be under powered, the SD card slot is short, card sticks out & could be damaged & the keyboard feels cramped, no dedicated video out, also Surface team needs to adopt Thunderbolt, USB-C is so yesterday on an otherwise VERY today device. My qualifications: 30yrs enterprise desktop support working with & evaluating PCs but this one is for me. I was looking at All-In-Ones that cost from $1985-2799 when the SB2 came out. I passed on them for the portability of an SB2 with better hardware than AIOs. Glad I did.",
